# CO2 Emissions Prediction using Random Forest Regression

This repository contains code for predicting CO2 emissions of vehicles using Random Forest Regression. The dataset used for training and testing the model consists of various features related to vehicles such as engine size, cylinders, fuel consumption, make, vehicle class, transmission, and fuel type.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project contains information about vehicles and their CO2 emissions. It includes both numerical and categorical features. 

## Contents

- `CO2_Emissions_Prediction.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook containing the code for data exploration, preprocessing, model training, and prediction.
- `README.md`: This file providing information about the project and instructions on how to use the code.
- `data.csv`: The dataset used for training and testing the model.
- `requirements.txt`: File listing the required Python packages and their versions.

## Getting Started

To run the code, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required dependencies by running `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. Open and run the `CO2_Emissions_Prediction.ipynb` notebook using Jupyter or any compatible environment.

## Usage

1. **Data Exploration**: Explore the dataset to understand its structure and features.
2. **Data Preprocessing**: Handle missing values, encode categorical variables, and prepare the data for training.
3. **Model Training**: Train a Random Forest Regression model using the prepared data.
4. **Model Evaluation**: Evaluate the performance of the trained model using test data.
5. **Prediction**: Use the trained model to make predictions on new data, such as user-input vehicle information.
